1 Implementation of SmiHashFile using the Berkeley-DB

April 2002 Ulrich Telle

September 2002 Ulrich Telle, fixed flag (DB\_DIRTY\_READ) in Berkeley DB calls for system catalog files

April 2003 Ulrich Telle, implemented temporary SmiFiles

May 2008, Victor Almeida created the two sons of the ~SmiKeyedFile~ class, namely ~SmiBtreeFile~ and
~SmiHashFile~, for B-Tree and hash access methods, respectively.
