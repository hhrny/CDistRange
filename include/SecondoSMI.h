1 Header File: Storage Management Interface

April 2002 Ulrich Telle

November 30, 2002 RHG Added function ~GetKey~.

April, 2004. F.Hoffmann changed implementation details of static method
'ListDatabases'.

Aug 18, 2004. M. Spiekermann added ~Setflag\_NOSYNC~ to speed up closing files
at the end of a query. Since queries does not modify the data synchronisation is
not necessary.

Sept 15, 2004. M. Spiekermann. Declaration of SmiError moved to ErrorCodes.h.

Nov 2004. M. Spiekermann. Some functions were implemented as inline functions.

Feb. 2006. M. Spiekermann Some new functions were declared which allow to set up
only a temporary BDB-Environment needed for the implementation of persistent
nested lists.


1.1 Overview

The *Storage Management Interface* provides all types and classes needed
for dealing with persistent data objects in "Secondo"[3].

Essential for all operations on persistent data objects is the class
~SmiEnvironment~ which provides methods for startup and shutdown of
the storage management, for transaction handling and for error handling.

Internally the ~SmiEnvironment~ handles the connection to the underlying
implementation of the persistent information storage management. Currently
implementations based on the "Berkeley DB"[3] library and on the "Oracle"[3] DBMS
are available. The decision which implementation is used is taken at link
time of the "Secondo"[3] server. Fine tuning of implementation dependent
parameters is done by means of a configuration file which is read at system
startup. For future extensions (i.e. user management and access control)
it is possible to store the current user identification in the ~SmiEnvironment~.

Additionally the ~SmiEnvironment~ introduces the concept of ~databases~. Within
one ~SmiEnvironment~ there may exist several databases, but a user may access
only *one* database at a single time. A valid database name consists of at most
"SMI\_MAX\_DBNAMELEN"[4] (currently 15) alphanumeric characters or underscores. The
first character has to be alphabetic. Database names are *not* case sensitive.

Persistent objects are stored as records in so called ~SmiFiles~. An ~SmiFile~
is a handle to its representation in the interface implementation. Two kinds
of ~SmiFiles~ are provided: one for record oriented access and one for key
oriented access. An ~SmiFile~ always has a ~context~, default or user specified.
The context allows to adjust implementation dependent parameters to benefit
from special knowledge about the objects to be stored in this context. These
parameters are specified in the configuration file under the appropriate
context section heading.

An ~SmiFile~ is always represented by a unique numeric identifier. Additionally
it may have a name. Without a name an ~SmiFile~ is said to be ~anonymous~. Within
a context a name must be unique. ~SmiFile~ names and context names are case
sensitive and may have at most "SMI\_MAX\_NAMELEN"[4] (currently 31) alphanumeric
characters or underscores. The first character has to be alphabetic.

An ~SmiFile~ for record oriented access is called ~SmiRecordFile~. Records can be
of fixed or variable size. The use of ~SmiFiles~ with fixed length records is
recommended whereever appropriate since they may be more efficient -- depending
on the implementation. Records can only be appended to the end of an ~SmiFile~,
but can be accessed for reading, update or deletion in random order using their
record number. An iterator for sequential access to all records of an ~SmiFile~ is
provided.

An ~SmiFile~ for key oriented access is called ~SmiKeyedFile~, which is itself
divided into two kinds, called ~SmiBtreeFile~ and ~SmiHashFile~, depending on
the storage method, a B-Tree and a Hash, respectively. An ~SmiKeyFile~ is
capable of holding pairs of keys and data. Both keys and data may be of variable
size. While the size of the data is only restricted by physical limits of the
available hardware, the size of keys is restricted to at most 4000 bytes.
(This limit is imposed by the VARCHAR2 datatype of "Oracle"[3], but depending on the
actual database configuration the maximal possible key length might be lower.
Other relational database systems allow only much smaller keys, i.e. "MySQL"[3]
restricts the combined key length to 512 bytes, but a single column key cannot
exceed 255 bytes and that would be the restriction for an implementation based
on "MySQL"[3].)

As key types signed integers, floating point numbers, and strings are supported.
Keys may also have a more complex structure as long as the user provides a
function for mapping a key to a byte string which obeys to a lexical order.
Keys may be unique or may allow for duplicate data. The use of iterators is
mandatory for access to duplicates. Iterators for access to all records or
records within a specified range of keys are provided.

An ~SmiRecord~ handle is used to access complete or partial records of an ~SmiFile~.

1.2 Transaction handling

The storage management interface provides methods to start, commit and abort
transactions. All access to persistent objects should be done within user
transactions. User transactions are *not* started automatically. Due to limitations
of the transaction support of the "Berkeley DB"[3] it is recommended that applications
using this interface should run in a sort of auto-commit mode by surrounding
very few atomic operations with calls to the start and commit transaction methods.
Only application which are able to repeat transactions easily in case of failure
may use more complex transactions.

Although both current implementations of the storage
management interface support transaction logic for data manipulation statements,
there is no support for transaction logic for data definition statements
(creation and deletion of ~SmiFiles~). Therefore the update of the SmiFile
catalog and the deletion of ~SmiFiles~ are postponed until completion or rollback
of a transaction. If the ~SmiFile~ catalog update fails, the transaction is
aborted and rolled back automatically.

1.3 Interface methods

The class ~SmiEnvironment~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Environment     & Transaction handling & Error handling     \\
        [--------]
        StartUp         & BeginTransaction     & CheckLastErrorCode \\
        ShutDown        & CommitTransaction    & GetLastErrorCode   \\
        SetUser         & AbortTransaction     & SetError           \\
        CreateDatabase  &  &  \\
        OpenDatabase    &  &  \\
        CloseDatabase   &  &  \\
        EraseDatabase   &  &  \\
        ListDatabases   &  &  \\
        IsDatabaseOpen  &  &  \\
        CurrentDatabase &  &  \\

The classes ~SmiRecordFile~ and ~SmiKeyedFile~ inherit the following methods
from their base class ~SmiFile~:

[23]    Creation/Removal & Open/Close & Information \\
        [--------]
  Create           & Open        & GetContext \\
  Drop             & Close       & GetName    \\
  Truncate         &             & GetFileId  \\
                   &             & IsOpen     \\

The class ~SmiRecordFile~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal     & Record Selection & Record Modification \\
        [--------]
        SmiRecordFile        & SelectRecord     & AppendRecord \\
        [tilde]SmiRecordFile & SelectAll        & DeleteRecord \\
        GetData              &                  &               \\

The class ~SmiKeyedFile~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal    & Record Selection & Record Modification \\
        [--------]
        SmiKeyedFile        & SelectRecord     & InsertRecord \\
        [tilde]SmiKeyedFile &                  & DeleteRecord \\

The class ~SmiBtreeFile~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal    & Record Selection  \\
        [--------]
        SmiBtreeFile        & SelectRange       \\
        [tilde]SmiBtreeFile & SelectLeftRange   \\
                            & SelectRightRange  \\

The class ~SmiBtreeFile~ provides only the creation and removal functions, since
all its functionality is provided in the ~SmiKeyedFile~:

[23]    Creation/Removal    \\
        [--------]
        SmiHashFile        \\
        [tilde]SmiHashFile \\

The class ~SmiRecord~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal & Persistence & Querying \\
        [--------]
        SmiRecord        & Read        & Size \\
        [tilde]SmiRecord & Write       &      \\
        Finish           & Truncate    & Resize \\

The classes ~SmiRecordFileIterator~ and ~SmiKeyedFileIterator~ provide the
following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal             & Access        & Querying \\
        [--------]
        SmiRecordFileIterator        & Next          & EndOfScan \\
        [tilde]SmiRecordFileIterator & DeleteCurrent &  \\
        SmiKeyedFileIterator         & Restart       &  \\
        [tilde]SmiKeyedFileIterator  & Finish        &  \\

The class ~SmiKey~ provides the following methods:

[23]    Creation/Removal & Access      & Key mapping   \\
        [--------]
        SmiKey           & GetKey      & Map           \\
        [tilde]SmiKey    & KeyDataType & Unmap         \\

1 Declaration of the Storage Management Interface for UrelAlgebra

1.1 Overview

The storage management interface of the UrelAlgebra
supports basic I/O methods for let urel object to access
the memory pool file in the Berkely DB environment.
This is one part of the whole storage management interface
of the Secondo system.

The interface is composed by two classes,  *SmiUpdateFile*
and *SmiUpdatePage*. The SmiUpdateFile provides methods
for accessing the whole file of an urel object. The main methods
are listed below:

  * Create

  * Open

  * Close

  * AppendNewPage

  * GetPage

  * PutPage

Create is used to create a new memory pool file, and use Open
method to access an exist memory pool file, then use Close method
to flush all unsaved data to the disk and release the handle to the file.

AppendNewPage is used to add a new page in this file, and use the
GetPage method to map an exist page in the disk file to the main memory,
and lock that part of memory so that different processes can share
the same page, that's what we call pin that page in the memory.
When the page is useless, then use PutPage method to flush the data back
to the disk file, and unpin the page.

The SmiUpdatePage provides access methods to one page in the
memory pool file. There are two main methods: read and write,
with which we can read and write any type of data in this page.
